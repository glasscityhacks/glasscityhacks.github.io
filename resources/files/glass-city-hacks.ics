SUMMARY:Glass City Hacks
URL:http%3A%2F%2Fglasscityhacks.com
DESCRIPTION:With Toledo's first Hackathon\, we want to bring together students in computer science\, engineering\, designers\, artists\, business\, and others to learn and build real world products that solve real world problems. \n\nOver the course of 36 hours\, students from all over the region and beyond will embark on a journey to learn from each other\, create a product\, and demonstrate its effectiveness. \n\nWe encourage students to gain knowledge\, immerse themselves in the Toledo ecosystem\, and even put themselves in front of perspective employers during an all-expenses-paid weekend of hard work\, entertainment\, and education.
LOCATION:Toledo Museum of Art\, 2445 Monroe St.\, Toledo\, OH 43620
