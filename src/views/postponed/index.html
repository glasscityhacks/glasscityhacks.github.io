				<p><strong>Dear Hackathon Registrants, Volunteers, and Toledoans,</strong></p>
				<p>
					It's with a heavy heart that we announce that Glass City Hacks has been postponed indefinitely due to
					logistical and venue issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					We want to thank everyone who helped us along the way to bring about Toledo's first hackathon. While
					the dream hasn't yet been realized, we've laid tremendous groundwork in educating the community and gauging
					that this is definitely an event that Toledo wants.
				</p>
				<p>
					We have opensourced our planning, brand, and website materials under MIT at the
					<a href="https://github.com/glasscityhacks">Glass City Hacks Github</a>, and we intend to make
					available the web properties and accounts for later use.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are so many amazing things that a hackathon can bring to Toledo, but we still have plenty to
					show the world that <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/youwilldobetterintoledo">#youwilldobetterintoledo</a>.

				<p>
					<strong>Thank you, and we'll see you again soon!</strong><br />
