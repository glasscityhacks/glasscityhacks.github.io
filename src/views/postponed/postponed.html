				<p><strong>Dear Hackathon Registrants, Volunteers, and Toledoans,</strong></p>
				<p>
					It's with a heavy heart that we announce that Glass City Hacks has been postponed indefinitely due to
					logistical and venue issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					We want to thank everyone who helped us along the way to bring about Toledo's first hackathon. While
					the dream hasn't yet been realized, we've laid tremendous groundwork in educating the community and gauging
					that this is definitely an event that Toledo wants.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are so many amazing things that a hackathon can bring to Toledo, but we still have plenty to
					show the world that <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/youwilldobetterintoledo">#youwilldobetterintoledo</a>.

					<strong>Thank you, and we'll see you again soon!</strong><br />
